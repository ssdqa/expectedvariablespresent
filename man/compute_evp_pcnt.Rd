\usage{
compute_evp_pcnt(
  cohort,
  grouped_list,
  time = FALSE,
  evp_variable_file = expectedvariablespresent::evp_variable_file_pcornet
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{table of cohort members with at least \code{site}, \code{person_id}, \code{start_date}, and \code{end_date}}

\item{grouped_list}{list of columns that should be used to group the table}

\item{time}{logical to determine whether the function is being run as part of \code{compute_fot} or not}

\item{evp_variable_file}{CSV file with information about each of the variables that should be
examined in the function. contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{variable} a label for the variable captured by the associated codeset
\item \code{default_tbl} CDM table where data related to the codeset is found
\item \code{concept_field} concept_id field with codes from the associated codeset
\item \code{date_field} a date field in the \code{default_tbl} that should be used for over time analyses
\item \code{vocabulary_field} PCORNET ONLY; field in the \code{default_tbl} that defines the vocabulary type of the concept (i.e. dx_type)
if this field is used, the codeset should have a \code{vocabulary_id} column that defines the appropriate vocabularies for each concept
\item \code{codeset_name} the name of the codeset file; DO NOT include the file extension
\item \code{filter_logic} a string indicating filter logic that should be applied to achieve the desired variable; optional
}}
}
\value{
dataframe with patient/row counts and proportions that are computed per group defined in
grouped_list, and if time = TRUE, for each time period defined in compute_fot
}
